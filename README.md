### Hello, I'm Roberto

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r-jasinski/r-jasinski/master/header.png" alt="banner that says Monica Powell - software engineer, content creator and community organizer alongside a cartoon illustration of Monica">

Iâ€™ve working as a front-end engineer for almost 5 years, and I enjoy it more every day. Iâ€™m skilled in HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Vue, React/Next, Web-Components, Lit, PWA, Git, Testing, SEO, Accessibility, Scrum etc.

I also have a strong interest in UI/UX and currently I'm helping Voith Group to create and maintain a common style guide/design system.

I have a Master's Degree in User Experience Design, a Bachelor's Degree in Communication and a Bachelor of Technology - BTech in System Analysis and Development.

I really believe that it is necessary to bridge the gap between design and technology, allowing the more technically oriented side of the team (the developers) to understand what the vision of the project (designers) is.

I'm also a good learner and a proficient google searcher ðŸ˜‰!!

Almost all of my work is under NDA, but you can see a little more about me and take a look at my latest public projects at [www.robertojasinski.dev](https://www.robertojasinski.dev/)
