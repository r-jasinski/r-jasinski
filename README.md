I'm a front-end engineer who is fascinated by bringing the best user experience. I always look forward to learning new concepts and technologies to deliver it. Iâ€™m currently working mainly with React/Vue.Js and I design and create prototypes of my work using Adobe products (XD, Illustrator, Photoshop).

My last project: [https://www.ace-lms.com.br/](https://www.ace-lms.com.br/)
